@module os

# Introduction

The `os:` module provides access to operating system functionality. The
interface is intended to be uniform across operating systems.

The [builtin module](builtin.html) also contains some operating system
utilities. The [`unix:` module](unix.html) contains utilities that are specific
to UNIX operating systems.

Function usages are given in the same format as in the reference doc for the
[builtin module](builtin.html).
