# Breaking changes

# Deprecated features

**TODO**: Show warnings when these feature are used (#898).

-   The `&display-suffix` option of the `edit:complex-candidate` is now
    deprecated. Use the `&display` option instead.

-   The `explode` command is now deprecated. Use `all` instead.

# Notable new features

-   A new `platform:` module has been introduced.

-   A new `unix:` module has been introduced.

-   A new `math:` module has been introduced.

-   Scripts may now use relative `use` to import files outside `~/.elvish/lib`.

-   Dynamic strings may now be used as command as long as they contain slashes
    ([#764](https://b.elv.sh/764)).

-   The `all` command no longer preserves byte inputs as is; instead it turns
    them into values, one each line. It also accepts an optional list argument,
    consistent with other value-taking commands.

-   A new `one` command has been added.

-   A new `read-upto` command can now be added to read byte inputs up to a
    delimiter ([#831](https://b.elv.sh/831)).

-   The ratios of the column widths in navigation mode can now be configured
    with `$edit:navigation:width-ratio` ([#464](https://b.elv.sh/464))

-   In the interactive REPL, the user can now prefix the command with a space to
    prevent it from being saved in the command history.

-   The printing of floating-point numbers has been tweaked to feel much more
    natural ([#811](https://b.elv.sh/811)).

-   The `edit:complex-candidate` now supports a `&display` option to specify the
    full display text.

-   Elvish now uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to keep runtime files if possible.

-   Elvish now increments the `$SHLVL` environment variable.

# Notable bugfixes

-   Elvish no longer crashes when redirecting to a high FD
    ([#788](https://b.elv.sh/788)).

-   Indexing access to nonexistent variables now correctly triggers a
    compilation error ([#889](https://b.elv.sh/889)).

-   The interactive REPL no longer highlights complex commands as red
    ([#881](https://b.elv.sh/881)).

-   Glob patterns after `~username` now evaluate correctly
    ([#793](https://b.elv.sh/793)).

-   On Windows, tab completions for directories no longer add superfluous quotes
    backslashes ([#897](https://b.elv.sh/897)).

-   The `edit:move-dot-left-small-word` command has been fixed to actually move
    by a small word instead of a word.

-   A lot of race conditions have been fixed ([#73](https://b.elv.sh),
    [#754](https://b.elv.sh/754)).
