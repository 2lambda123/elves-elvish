Draft release notes for Elvish 0.20.0.

# Notable new features

-   The `peach` command now has a `&num-workers` option
    ([#648](https://github.com/elves/elvish/issues/648)).

-   A new `str:fields` command ([#1689](https://b.elv.sh/1689)).

-   The language server now supports showing the documentation of builtin
    functions and variables on hover ([#1684](https://b.elv.sh/1684)).

# Breaking changes

-   The `except` keyword in the `try` command was deprecated since 0.18.0 and is
    now removed. Use `catch` instead.
