# Breaking changes

*   This release sees a total rewrite of the line editor. As a result, there
    have been some changes to its API, the `edit:` module:

    -   Binding tables no longer support the `default` key for overriding the
        default behavior of modes. All the `edit:<mode>:default` functions
        have been removed: `edit:completion:default`, `edit:history:default`,
        `edit:insert:default`, `edit:listing:default` and
        `edit:navigation:default`.

    -   The `edit:listing:backspace` function has been removed. There is no
        replacement; Backspace handling is now baked into the default behavior
        and no key binding is needed.
        
    -   The `edit:insert-key` function has been removed. There is no
        replacement; key insertion is now baked into the default behavior and
        no key binding is needed.

    -   The `edit:lastcmd:accept-line` function has been removed. Use
        `edit:listing:accept` instead.

    -   The `edit:-narrow-read` function and the `edit:narrow:` module have
        been removed. Used `edit:listing:start-custom` instead.

    -   The `edit:styled` function has been removed. Used `styled` instead.
    
    -   The `edit:insert:start` function has been removed. Use
        `edit:listing:close` instead.

    -   The `edit:location:matcher` variable and
        `edit:location:match-dir-pattern` function have been removed. There is
        no replacement yet; the location matcher is not customizable now,
        although it may be made customizable again in a future version.

    -   The `edit:completion:trigger-filter` function has been removed. The
        completion mode now always focuses on the filter, and it is no longer
        possible to focus on the main buffer during completion.
    
    -   The `edit:history:list` function has been removed. There is no
        replacement yet.
