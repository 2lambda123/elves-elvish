This is the draft release notes for 0.18.0, scheduled to be released around
2022-03-01.

# Breaking changes

-   Within double quotes, `\x` followed by two hexadecimal digits and `\`
    followed by three octal digits now encode an individual byte, rather than a
    codepoint.

# Deprecated features

Deprecated features will be removed in 0.19.0.

The following deprecated features trigger a warning whenever the code is parsed
or compiled, even if it is not executed:

-   The legacy temporary assignment syntax (e.g. `a=foo echo $a`) is deprecated.
    Use the new `tmp` command instead (e.g. `tmp a = foo; echo $a`).

# Notable bugfixes

-   The output longer than terminal width is now shown fully on Windows
    Terminal.

-   Changing directories in the navigation mode now correctly runs hooks and
    updates `$E:PWD`.

# Notable new features

-   A new `flag:` module for parsing command-line flags.

-   A new `tmp` special command for doing temporary assignments.

-   A new `call` command to call a command, using a list for and a map for
    options.
